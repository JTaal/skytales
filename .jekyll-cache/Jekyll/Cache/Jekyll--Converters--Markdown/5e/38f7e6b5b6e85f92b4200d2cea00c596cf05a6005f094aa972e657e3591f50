I"”<p>The visualization you see is an attempt to represent a four-dimensional concept in a 3D space. The signal is a complex exponential:</p>

\[s(t) = e^{j\theta(t)} = \cos(\theta(t)) + j\sin(\theta(t))\]

<p>Here, the phase <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Œ∏(t)</code> is not linear. Its derivative, the instantaneous frequency, increases over time. This is called a ‚Äúchirp‚Äù signal.</p>

<h3 id="the-axes">The Axes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Real Axis (X):</strong> Represents the real part, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cos(Œ∏(t))</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imaginary Axis (Y):</strong> Represents the imaginary part, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sin(Œ∏(t))</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequency Axis (Z):</strong> This axis is used to represent the passage of time, during which the frequency increases, causing the spiral to tighten.</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates the distinctive ‚Äúchirping‚Äù spiral you see.</p>
