The visualization you see is an attempt to represent a four-dimensional concept in a 3D space. The signal is a complex exponential:

$$ s(t) = e^{j\theta(t)} = \cos(\theta(t)) + j\sin(\theta(t)) $$

Here, the phase `θ(t)` is not linear. Its derivative, the instantaneous frequency, increases over time. This is called a "chirp" signal.

### The Axes

-   **Real Axis (X):** Represents the real part, `cos(θ(t))`.
-   **Imaginary Axis (Y):** Represents the imaginary part, `sin(θ(t))`.
-   **Frequency Axis (Z):** This axis is used to represent the passage of time, during which the frequency increases, causing the spiral to tighten.

This creates the distinctive "chirping" spiral you see.
